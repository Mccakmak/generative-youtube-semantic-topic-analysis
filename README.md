# üß† YouTube Emotion, Topic, and Relevance Analysis using LLaMA

This project utilizes LLaMA (Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct) to automatically assess the emotional tone, relevance, engagement, and topical classification of YouTube videos across depth-based recommendation networks. It includes scripts to preprocess data, generate predictions, and produce insightful visualizations.

## üìå Key Features

- **Emotion Analysis:** Detect emotional signals in YouTube video titles and transcripts.
- **Topic Categorization:** Classify videos into topics like politics, entertainment, and non-entertainment.
- **LLaMA-Based Relevance Scoring:** Evaluate semantic relevance of videos to the root using LLaMA's language understanding.
- **Engagement Analysis:** Visualize how engagement metrics (views, likes, comments) evolve by depth.
- **Graphical Output:** Generate high-resolution, publication-ready visualizations in PDF format.

## üîç Core Components

### `main.py`
- Uses Meta-LLaMA to rate how relevant a video title or transcript is to a root query.
- Generates integer score between 0‚Äì3:
  - 3: Highly relevant
  - 2: Partially relevant
  - 1: Loosely related
  - 0: Not relevant
- Produces `.csv` files with relevance scores and computes evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall).

### `analyze_relevancy.py`
- Normalizes and plots average relevance score vs. network depth.
- Overlays standard deviation bands for title and transcription-based scores.

### `analyze_engagement_moving.py`
- Plots log-transformed views, likes, comments across depths.
- Smooths trend lines with moving averages and highlights variances.

### `analyze_topics.py`
- Uses topic annotations (e.g., 0: Politics, 1: Entertainment, 2: Non-Entertainment).
- Outputs stacked topic ratios per depth.
- Saves topic probabilities to CSV for further use.

### `Engagements.py`
- Compares engagement statistics of videos with vs. without symbolic imagery.
- Uses bar charts with side-by-side visual comparison.
